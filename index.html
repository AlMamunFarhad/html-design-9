            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i> I NEED TO LOSE MORE WEIGHT, HOW DO I CONTINUE AFTER THE 21 DAYS?</h2>
            <p>The best part of The Smoothie Diet is that you can use it for as long as you need, to lose as much weight as you want. I make it super simple to continue using everything you learn in the first 3 weeks to extend the program for the next few weeks or even months. <strong>And each additional week will be just as enjoyable as the first three!</strong> My goal is to give you all the tools you need to continue losing weight and getting healthy for as long as you need to.</p>

          <div class="content-2 pb-4">
            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i> WON'T I JUST GAIN ALL THE WEIGHT BACK?</h2>
            <p>Unlike other diets, <strong>this is not a “quick-fix”.</strong> 21 days is only the beginning to a lifetime of better health and a slimmer body. The #1 comment I get on The Smoothie Diet is that after a few weeks, the cravings for sweets and junk foods have essentially disappeared. This makes it very easy to keep the weight off. I also show you exactly how to transition back into your regular eating patterns after the 21 days while still incorporating smoothies into your diet to keep the weight off. In fact, most people love the smoothies so much they don’t want to give them up after the 21 days! As some of my clients have said, <strong>this is a complete life-transformation program.</strong></p>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i>  I HAVE TYPE-2 DIABETES, WILL THIS WORK FOR ME?</h2>
            <p>Fresh, whole fruits, as well as blended green smoothies not only provide a healthy way for diabetics to get more fruits and vegetables in their diet, <strong>green smoothies also may help reverse some of the diet and lifestyle problems that exacerbate diabetes, or contributes to its progression.</strong> The great thing about the Smoothie Diet is that it kicks off a chain-reaction of lifestyle changes that reduce or eliminate the factors that exacerbate the disease, and reverses the condition in some individuals. Please note that while I am a nutrition expert, I am not a doctor. If you have diabetes or ANY other health condition, you should always consults with your doctor first before making any dietary changes.</p>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i>   I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME IN THE DAY, IS THIS HARD TO FOLLOW?</h2>
            <p><strong>If you don’t have a lot of time in the day, then this program is PERFECT for you.</strong> My ideal customer is a busy mom who works, goes to school, has errands to run, kids to drop off/pick up, etc. I designed this program to be super simple and take minutes a day. I even provide tips on how to cut corners to shave some valuable extra minutes off your smoothie prep. The recipes are quick to make and you can either enjoy them right after you make them or take them with you. You’ll always have a delicious, filling meal with you. And if you can press one button on your blender then you can follow this program :)</p>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i>   DO I NEED AN EXPENSIVE BLENDER OR ARE THE INGREDIENTS HARD TO FIND?</h2>
             <p>With the increased popularity of smoothies, blender prices have gotten very competitive. The most important thing is to have a blender with a strong motor. While the bender you have now will probably work just fine, If you are serious about making a big change in your health, then I show you some of the top-of-the-line blenders. But I also show you cheaper models that will work just fine and are under $50. The ingredients are not hard to find and if they are, <strong>I provide a full “Swap List” that shows you easy substitutes to use if you can’t find something.</strong></p>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COMES IN THE MAIL?</h2>
              <p>This is a fully digital product. You will not receive anything in the mail. <strong>The great thing about this is that you will have access to it in minutes.</strong> You don't have to wait for anything to arrive on your doorstep. I want to harness the excitement you're feeling right now and get you started right away. You can even do your week 1 shopping today and start tomorrow…or start today! The files are in PDF format. After you checkout, you will automatically be taken to a page where you can download and view everything on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. For those of you who would prefer a printed book, the Quickstart Bonus is designed for this. It is a 20-page shortened version of the main guide that can be printed out and followed just like a printed book.</p>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-question-circle-fill"></i> WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME?</h2>
              <p>If for some reason this program does not work for you even though you have followed it exactly as I have laid out, I have no problem giving you a full refund. <strong>I'll even cover you for a full 60 days so if you are unhappy for any reason over the next 2 months, you get your money back.</strong> If you are not happy with the program, then I don’t want you to have to pay for it. I believe in building relationships with my customers and your satisfaction is my #1 priority.</p>
